      question: "What is The Best Time To Perform Umrah?",
      answer:
        "Umrah can be performed at any time of the year, but the months of Ramadan and the off-peak seasons (outside of Hajj) are considered ideal due to lesser crowds and greater spiritual rewards during Ramadan.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Long Does Umrah Typically Take?",
      answer:
        "Umrah usually takes between 3 to 6 hours to complete, depending on the crowd and the individualâ€™s pace. This includes performing Tawaf, Sa'i, and Taqsir or Halq.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the differences between Hajj and Umrah?",
      answer:
        "Hajj is an obligatory pilgrimage for Muslims who meet certain conditions and is performed only during specific dates in Dhul Hijjah. Umrah, on the other hand, is a voluntary pilgrimage that can be performed any time of the year and involves fewer rituals.",
    },
    {
      question: "What Are The Essential Items To Pack For Umrah?",
